                    <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Project Overview</h2>
                    <p>The Weather Analysis Dashboard is a comprehensive web application designed to visualize and analyze 50 years of historical weather data. Our project aims to provide researchers, educators, and weather enthusiasts with a powerful tool to explore temperature trends and patterns over time.</p>
                    <p>Using state-of-the-art data visualization techniques with D3.js and Chart.js, we present complex weather data in intuitive, interactive formats that reveal insights that might otherwise remain hidden in raw datasets.</p>

                    <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Data Sources</h2>
                    <p>Our temperature data comes from reliable meteorological sources and has been carefully processed to ensure accuracy. The dataset includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Monthly average temperatures spanning 50 years</li>
                        <li>Minimum and maximum temperature recordings</li>
                        <li>Data from various cities across different Indian states</li>
                        <li>Quality-controlled measurements to eliminate outliers and errors</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>All temperature values are measured in degrees Celsius and collected from official weather stations.</p>

                    <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Visualization Techniques</h2>
                    <p>We employ several innovative visualization techniques to represent weather data:</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="h5 mt-4">Temperature Spiral</h3>
                    <p>Inspired by climate scientist Ed Hawkins, our temperature spiral displays months as angles and temperature as radius, spiraling outward chronologically to show temperature changes over decades in a compelling visual format.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="h5 mt-4">Heatmap Visualization</h3>
                    <p>Our heatmap uses color intensity to represent temperature values across a grid of years and months, making it easy to identify seasonal patterns and long-term trends at a glance.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="h5 mt-4">Bar Chart Race</h3>
                    <p>The animated bar chart race shows how monthly temperatures have changed year by year, providing a dynamic view of temperature evolution over time.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="h5 mt-4">Line Charts</h3>
                    <p>Various line chart visualizations offer detailed views of yearly averages, monthly patterns, and minimum/maximum temperature ranges, allowing for precise analysis of temperature data.</p>
